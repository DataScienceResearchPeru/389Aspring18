Here is some material we think would be helpful for this week's class.

1. **The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks**

A nice blog by Andrej Karpathy highlighting the effectiveness of RNNs is [here](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).

2. **Understanding LSTM Networks**

An easy to understand introduction [here](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).
