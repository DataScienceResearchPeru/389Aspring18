# Papers

Here are some papers I think are really good and worth knowing about. Don't worry if you find the math too complicated to follow along, just focus on the big ideas that the paper presented. Reading papers is often the best way to come up with ideas for new papers as well as reinforce your understanding on the subject.

## Extra Credit (1% per paper)
For an oppurtunity to get extra credit in the class you can do the following. Pick a paper that you find interesting (it doesn't have to be in the list) and answer the following questions (min 3 detailed sentences per question):
1. **Title/Authors**: What is the title of the paper you read and who are the authors?
2. **Link**: Link to the paper you read.
3. **Summary**: Summarize the problem the paper attempted to solve, how they solved it (in general terms), and  their results. 
4. **Contributions**: What were some of the key contributions in the paper?
5. **What did you like?**: Based on the material presented in the paper, what aspects did you find particularly interesting?
6. **How does this relate?**: How does the content covered in the paper relate to what we've been talking about in the class?

EveryIf you do this well, you can earn 1% per paper you write about. For submissions that clearly show a lack of effort or thought, no credit will be given. Please email me a PDF containing your answers to the questions. My email is [svishwaj@terpmail.umd.edu](mailto:svishwaj@terpmail.umd.edu).
