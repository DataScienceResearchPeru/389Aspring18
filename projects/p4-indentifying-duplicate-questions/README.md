## Overview
### Submission
You will turn in the assigment using the submit server. Please make sure your zip file follows the format `project_N_firstname_lastname.zip`. Where `N` is the project number, `firstname` is your first name, and `lastname` is your last name. Failing to follow this will result in a 5 point deduction.

## Assignment
Using what you've learnt in the class, build a LSTM model that accomplishes this. It should output 1 value which is the probability of being a duplicate question. As you can guess, this is a binary classification problem. You can take advantage of Keras and any other preprocessing or data libraries in your code.
